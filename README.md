# Soil Uncertainty Quantification
Reproducible code for the paper titled "Quantifying Uncertainty in the Prediction of Soil Properties Using Mid-Infrared Spectra"

## To Run the GAM, PLS, and PLS-Bootstrap Models
Run the R Markdown file in the "PLS_GAM_RMD" folder. 

All data and files are located in the X drive (X:\Lincoln\Smap-CovariateLayers\Spectroscopy_Modelling\).

## To Run the Bayesian Model 
Run the python notebook for the individual soil properties
